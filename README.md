# Setting up the SQL Database
For this project, we used [MySQL Workbench](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/) to set up and maintain our database. You can follow this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHTI_Nk7uwo) to setup MySQL workbench on Windows. Name your local database instance *nodemysql*, make the username *root*, and make the password *password*.
