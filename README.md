# DatabasesProject
Just how secure is your online data?  We built a website and used SQL Injection to steal and alter private data in the website's database.  A link to our paper can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19pUvf_Kk53pQMDVaDlpvup_pDUFb70mvgOwcqE3Ja6U/edit?usp=sharing).  A link to our presentation can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/13y7GKjgl4jdEsxMk1mM0r_UdmwwX2GFUT7vYhcCVv3Q/edit?usp=sharing). 


# Running the Code
After connecting to the repository, run the following at the root level:
### `npm install`

This should install necessary packages.  If you get error messages saying that you do not have a given package, run: 
### `npm install {package name}`

In the project directory, you can run:
### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any errors in the console.

Open another terminal and start the server by running: 
### `node server`

# Setting up the SQL Database
For this project, we used [MySQL Workbench](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/) to set up and maintain our database. You can follow this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHTI_Nk7uwo) to setup MySQL workbench on Windows. Name your local database instance *nodemysql*, make the username *root*, and make the password *password*.
